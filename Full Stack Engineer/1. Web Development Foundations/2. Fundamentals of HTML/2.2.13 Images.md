[[2.2 Learn HTML - Elements|<<Back]]

All of the elements you’ve learned about so far (headings, paragraphs, lists, and spans) share one thing in common: they’re composed entirely of text! What if you want to add content to your web page that isn’t composed of text, like [images](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/images?page_ref=catalog)?

The `<img>` tag allows you to add an image to a web page. Most elements require both opening and closing tags, but the `<img>` tag is a _self-closing tag_. Note that the end of the `<img>` tag has a forward slash `/`. Self-closing tags may include or omit the final slash — both will render properly.

```
<img src="image-location.jpg" />
```

The `<img>` tag has a required _attribute_ called `src`. The `src` attribute must be set to the image’s _source_, or the location of the image. In this case, the value of `src` must be the _uniform resource locator_ (URL) of the image. A URL is the web address or local address where a file is stored.
