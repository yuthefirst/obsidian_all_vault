You can also style text using HTML tags. The `<em>` tag emphasizes text, while the `<strong>` tag highlights important text.

Later, when you begin to style websites, you will decide how you want browsers to display content within `<em>` and `<strong>` tags. Browsers, however, have built-in style sheets that will generally style these tags in the following ways:

- The `<em>` tag will generally render as _italic_ emphasis.
- The `<strong>` will generally render as **bold** emphasis.

Take a look at each style in action:

```
<p><strong>The Nile River</strong> is the <em>longest</em> river in the world, measuring over 6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).</p>
```

In this example, the `<strong>` and `<em>` tags are used to emphasize the text to produce the following:

**The Nile River** is the _longest_ river in the world, measuring over 6,850 kilometers long (approximately 4,260 miles).

As we can see, “The Nile River” is bolded and “longest” is in italics.
