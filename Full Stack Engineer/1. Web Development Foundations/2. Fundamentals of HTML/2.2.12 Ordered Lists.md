[_Ordered lists_ (`<ol>`)](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements/ol?page_ref=catalog) are like unordered lists, except that each list item is numbered. They are useful when you need to list different steps in a process or rank items for first to last.

You can create the ordered list with the `<ol>` tag and then add individual list items to the list using `<li>` tags.

```
<ol>  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>  <li>Mix whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>  <li>Cream the butter, sugar in separate bowl.</li>  <li>Add eggs and vanilla extract to bowl.</li></ol>
```

The output will look like this:

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. Mix whole wheat flour, baking soda, and salt.
3. Cream the butter, sugar in separate bowl.
4. Add eggs and vanilla extract to bowl.
