Welcome to the world of code! Last year, millions of learners from our community started with HTML. Why? HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. It’s often the first language learned by developers, marketers, and designers and is core to front-end development work. If this is your first time touching code, we’re excited for what you’re about to create.

So what exactly is HTML? HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as [images](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/images), text, or [videos](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/videos). Right-click on any page on the internet, choose “Inspect,” and you’ll see HTML in a panel of your screen.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:

- A _markup_ language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.
- In HTML, the computer can interpret _raw text_ that is wrapped in HTML [elements](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/elements).
- _HyperText_ is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through [links](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/links), also known as _hyperlinks_. You probably clicked on a couple of hyperlinks on your way to this Codecademy course.

Learning HTML is the first step in creating websites, but even a bit of knowledge can help you inject code snippets into newsletter, blog or website templates. As you continue learning, you can layer HTML with CSS and JavaScript to create visually compelling and dynamic websites. But for now, we’re going to focus on how to add and modify basic content on a page, like text, images, and videos. Don’t worry if the websites look ugly — we’re just getting started.
