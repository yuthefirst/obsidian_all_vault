Congratulations on completing the first lesson of HTML! You are well on your way to becoming a skilled web developer.

Let’s review what you’ve learned so far:

- **HTML** stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
- Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
- HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
- Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing `<body>` tags.
- Headings and sub-headings, `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags, are used to provide titles for sections of content.
- `<p>`, `<span>` and `<div>` tags specify text or blocks.
- The `<em>` and `<strong>` tags are used to emphasize text.
- Line breaks are created with the `<br>` tag.
- Ordered lists (`<ol>`) are numbered and unordered lists (`<ul>`) are bulleted.
- Images (`<img>`) and videos (`<video>`) can be added by linking to an existing source.
