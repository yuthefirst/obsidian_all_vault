In addition to images, HTML also supports displaying [videos](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/html/videos?page_ref=catalog). Like the `<img>` element, the `<video>` element requires a `src` attribute with a link to the video source. Unlike the `<img>` element however, the `<video>` element requires an opening and a closing tag.

```
<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>  Video not supported</video>
```

In this example, the video source (`src`) is `"myVideo.mp4"`. The source can be a video file that is hosted alongside your webpage, or a URL that points to a video file hosted on another webpage.

After the `src` attribute, the `width` and `height` attributes are used to set the size of the video displayed in the browser. The `controls` attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls such as pausing and playing.

The text, `Video not supported`, between the opening and closing video tags will only be displayed if the browser is unable to load the video.

### Instructions

1. Checkpoint 1 Passed
    
    1.
    
    Under the image, create a `<video>` tag and add the following video url as the source:
    
    ```
    https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-1/lesson-2/htmlcss1-vid_brown-bear.mp4
    ```
    
    Be sure to create a closing tag as well with `</video>`.
    
    Hint
    
    Here’s an example video tag that would link to `myVideo.mp4` as the source:
    
    ```
    <video src="myVideo.mp4"></video>
    ```
    
2. Checkpoint 2 Passed
    
    2.
    
    Define the `width` of the video as `"320"` and the `height` as `"240"`. Make sure to also include the `controls` attribute.
    
    Hint
    
    Here’s how to define `height`, `width`, and the `controls` attribute for a video :
    
    ```
    <video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls></video>
    ```
    
3. Checkpoint 3 Passed
    
    3.
    
    In between the opening and closing `<video>` tags, add the phrase `Video not supported`, which will be displayed if the browser is unable to load your video.
