The spacing between code in an HTML file doesn’t affect the positioning of elements in the browser. If you are interested in modifying the spacing in the browser, you can use HTML’s _line break_ element: `<br>`.

The line break element is unique because it is only composed of a starting tag. You can use it anywhere within your HTML code and a line break will be shown in the browser.

```
<p>The Nile River is the longest river <br> in the world, measuring over 6,850 <br> kilometers long (approximately 4,260 <br> miles).</p>
```

The code in the example above will result in an output that looks like the following:

The Nile River is the longest river  
in the world, measuring over 6,850  
kilometers long (approximately 4,260  
miles).
