- [HTTP](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/http) status codes, like 404 Not Found
- Big trends in web development, from static websites to Web 2.0 and the rise of mobile

If you work with engineers, this information will help you talk about websites and web applications at a more technical level. Or if you’re interested in becoming a web developer yourself, you now have the important context to start building your own website or web application!
