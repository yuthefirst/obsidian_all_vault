See what you’ll be learning in the Overview of Web Development Unit.

The goal of this unit is to introduce you to the field of web development software engineering before diving into the technical parts of the track.

After this unit, you will be able to:

- Describe on a broad level how the internet works
- Identify different languages used for web development
- Define what programming is
- Summarize what a software engineer does in their job
- Explain the difference between front-end and back-end engineering (and full-stack!)

Learning is social. Whatever you’re working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the [forums](https://discuss.codecademy.com/). Remember to check in with the community regularly, including for things like asking for code reviews on your project work and providing code reviews to others in the [projects category](https://discuss.codecademy.com/c/project/1833), which can help to reinforce what you’ve learned.
