The _ML_ in HTML stands for _markup language_. Markup refers to a way of annotating text that is [[Term#distinguishable có thể phân biệt được|distinguishable]] from the text itself. The same way that a teacher might “markup” a student essay by underlining topic sentences and circling spelling errors, HTML annotates the content within a web page.

A teacher might use a red pen to make sure that their comments are easy to distinguish from the student’s own work. HTML separates content and annotation by using HTML tags, which are denoted by angle brackets (also known as less-than and greater-than signs).

### Instructions

Compare the markup for the essay to the markup in the HTML diagram. How do they compare?

Open the following dropdowns to see some sample comparisons:

#### Comparison 1

Both the HTML markup and the essay have sections of text. The HTML markup is separated by new lines and tags with `<>`. The essay has the text separated by new lines.

#### Comparison 2

Both documents include a title near the top. The HTML markup is titled “HTML Tutorial,” marked with `<title>` tags. The essay has “My Autobiography” as the title, which is annotated as “Title” with an arrow.

##### Comparison 3

Similar to the essay’s body text, the HTML has the tag `<body>` for the body text.

#### Comparison 4

In the essay, [[Term#portions of the body text phần nội dung văn bản|portions of the body text]] are annotated to indicate what purpose they serve in the text, such as “Hook,” “Thesis Statement,” and “Conclusion.”

In the `<body>` of the HTML, individual portions are annotated with HTML tags like `<p>` and `<h1>` to indicate the function that the text will serve on the web page. We’ll learn more about these tags in subsequent exercises!
